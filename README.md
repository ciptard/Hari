## Description

This is just a small CMS powered by a single folder. No database is required. 
All you do is drag and drop images / text files into the directory you choose, and that's it. Text posts can include Markdown too.
An example can be found at [Hari's Timeline](http://hari.matthojo.co.uk/).

## Installation

* Copy the programme to your websites directory.
* Edit the config.php file so the author and other settings are correct to you.
* Drag some images / .txt files into the 'display' folder or the folder you have set in the config.php folder.
* The post title is based on the filename, so, "this_is_an_image.jpg" turns into "This Is An Image".
* Thats it.

###Note
Files are ordered by modification date so, if you change a file once its in the timeline, it will appear at the top.
